Aang Saan Suu Kyi is complicit in the Burmese genocide of Rohingya muslims.
They are trying to eradicate their history of the Rohingya and try to label 
them as Bengali muslims from Bangladesh.

# Trade is not a zero sum game

An economist studied the effect of railway in India after the 1850s.
According to the study the annual income in India increased by 16% thanks to 
the railway. This is apparently proof for trade not being a zero sum game.

A simpler example is a community when it comes in contact with others, can stop
doing what they are really bad at and focus on the good things. This usuall 
leads to higher output.

# Cities and chain stores
Tags: cities
Date: 2017/04/30 
Hayes Valley in SF banned chain stores from opening in the neighborhood. Now it
is full of boutique stores that are not useful to the locals.

French have had rules against chain stores for a long time.
There is probably an underlying problem of smaller stores not being able to
compete and hence cities need to have laws against chain stores.

# California is trying to be the leader in climate policy

Date: 2017/05/06

California is trying to set an example by adopting really agressive cap and 
trade goals. If this legislation SB755 passes it will create a free market for 
carbon trading and abolish carbon offsets.

There are a few interesting things about this legislation one being a Border
adjustment tax to be levied on imports from other states where carbon emission
tax / cost is cheaper. If this is executed well, this might lead other states
to adopt similar strickter measueres. The downside is a lot of industry can
move out of california to places where producing carbon is cheaper.

The legislation has a huge potential of producing lots of income for the state.
This income is being allocated to per-capita dividends, it is a nice effort
at redistribution as most of the money will go to the poorer people.
