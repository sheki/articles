	  <h1>The Fearless Girl statue is clever marketing</h1>
<ul>
<li>The statue of the fearless girl was placed in front of the chargin bull
by a NASDAQ fund to promote an index fund called SHE</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>but stock markets everywhere — everywhere — tanked. Arturo Di Modica, a
Sicilian immigrant who became a naturalized citizen of the U.S., responded by
creating Charging Bull — a bronze sculpture of a…well, a charging bull. It took
him two years to make it. The thing weighs more than 7000 pounds, and cost Di
Modica some US$350,000 of his own money. He said he wanted the bull to
represent “the strength and power of the American people”. He had it trucked
into the Financial District and set it up, completely without permission. It’s
maybe the only significant work of guerrilla capitalist art in existence.</p>
