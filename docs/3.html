	  <h1>Trade is not a zero sum game</h1>
<p>An economist studied the effect of railway in India after the 1850s.
According to the study the annual income in India increased by 16% thanks to
the railway. This is apparently proof for trade not being a zero sum game.</p>
<p>A simpler example is a community when it comes in contact with others, can stop
doing what they are really bad at and focus on the good things. This usuall
leads to higher output.</p>
