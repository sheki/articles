	  <h1>California is trying to be the leader in climate policy</h1>
<p>California is trying to set an example by adopting really agressive cap and
trade goals. If this legislation SB755 passes it will create a free market for
carbon trading and abolish carbon offsets.</p>
<p>There are a few interesting things about this legislation one being a Border
adjustment tax to be levied on imports from other states where carbon emission
tax / cost is cheaper. If this is executed well, this might lead other states
to adopt similar strickter measueres. The downside is a lot of industry can
move out of california to places where producing carbon is cheaper.</p>
<p>The legislation has a huge potential of producing lots of income for the state.
This income is being allocated to per-capita dividends, it is a nice effort
at redistribution as most of the money will go to the poorer people.</p>
