	  <h1>Cities and chain stores</h1>
<p>Hayes Valley in SF banned chain stores from opening in the neighborhood. Now it
is full of boutique stores that are not useful to the locals.</p>
<p>French have had rules against chain stores for a long time.
There is probably an underlying problem of smaller stores not being able to
compete and hence cities need to have laws against chain stores.</p>
